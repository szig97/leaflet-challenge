# leaflet-challenge
This repo contains my leaflet homework. The leaflet map displays data for Earthquakes that have occured within the past week. When you click on a circle, there will be a popup that will display the magnitude, depth, and the location of the earthquake. In addition, there is also a legend of the depth of the earthquake.
